This is the firmware for the <b>Electronics-Project Module</b>
<b>ET.PM3: Cable-Monitor</b>

@n As part of the Project Module 3 in the 5th Semester, the objective was to develop a Cable-Monitor.
This device should be able to find hidden cables in walls, floors and ceilings by measuring the
electromagnetic and electrostatic fields of the cable. By making use of the display from the 
provided development kit, the user is guided to the approximate location of the cable. In addition, 
audible feedback is provided using a buzzer and useful information such as the current and voltage, 
is shown on the display. To be able to measure such weak signals, an amplifier had to be used. The 
amplification was also paired with a Multi-Feedback-Bandpass-Filter (MFB) to eliminate unnecessary 
frequencies and filter out the wanted 50 Hz signal. Subsequently, the signal is fed into an
Analog-to-Digital-Converter (ADC) and read by the microcontroller. 
The final product aims to detect various types of cables, including one- or two-phased cables
and will feature an intuitive touch interface. The challenge extended beyond the realms of hardware 
and software to effective teamwork, as the project was a collaborative effort between two individuals. 
Successful completion required meticulous planning and coordination between team members.

Core

@n measuring.c prepares the measured data.
@n FLASH_SECTOR_F4.c is used to store the calibration values in the flash memory.
@n calculation.c performs the necessary calculations for displaying the measurements.
@n main.c puts everything together.

TouchGFX

@n In the src folder in generated/gui_generated, the code for all screen elements is generated. This was done using the TouchGFX Designer.
@n In the src folder in gui, the virtual functions are implemented.


@n The following renders show the front and back view of the cable monitor.

How to use
---
This Firmware offers a comprehensive set of features for cable measurement. It allows you to determine the distance to a cable, measure the current flowing through it, and identify its frequency. Additionally, it provides user-friendly guidance through a visual gauge that displays the angle to the cable.
In the measurement menu, users have the flexibility to choose between two modes: a single, quicker measurement that takes only about 5 periods of a 50Hz signal, or a more precise but slower accurate measurement, which requires approximately 50 periods for completion.
For enhanced accuracy, the calibration menu enables users to fine-tune distance and current measurements. These calibration values are securely stored in the microcontroller's flash memory.
In the main menu, located in the top left corner, users can access the settings menu to control the buzzer and LED functions. Furthermore, in the top right corner of the main menu, there is an option to disable the cable monitor.
Additionally, an information menu is available to provide users with detailed information about the cable monitor's functionality and operation.
